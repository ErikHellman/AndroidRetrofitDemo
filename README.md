# AndroidRetrofitDemo

This is a simple demo of how to use Retrofit, LiveData, and ViewModel to make API calls to Open Weather Map.

It is not a complete functional app, but rather a project you can use to get started for learning about the 
various parts involved in making RESTful API calls with Retrofit, and how to expose the response to your 
Android UI using ViewModel and LiveData.
